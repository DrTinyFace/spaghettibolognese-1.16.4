# Spaghetti Bolognese

Spaghetti Bolognese is a passion project developed by [Billeh007](https://www.curseforge.com/members/billeh007/projects) and serves as a restoration and reimagination of the original [Spaghetti Bolognese Mod](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/cr43z33m0nk3y/submissions/mods/) along with the other mods developed by CR43Z33M0NK3Y. CR43Z33M0NK3Y was a Minecraft modder who vanished from the face of the internet in approximately 2011, and has not been heard from since. The Spaghetti Bolognese mod attempts to reconstruct their original visionary mods from scratch, pulling only the textures from the original mods where possible.
