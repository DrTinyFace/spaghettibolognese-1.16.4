# Spaghetti Bolognese

Spaghetti Bolognese is a passion project developed by [Billeh007](https://www.curseforge.com/members/billeh007/projects) and serves as a restoration and reimagination of the original [Spaghetti Bolognese Mod](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/cr43z33m0nk3y/submissions/mods/) along with the other mods developed by CR43Z33M0NK3Y. CR43Z33M0NK3Y was a Minecraft modder who vanished from the face of the internet in approximately 2011, and has not been heard from since. The Spaghetti Bolognese mod attempts to reconstruct their original visionary mods from scratch, pulling only the textures from the original mods where possible.

## Current Additions

* Spaghetti Bolognese Mod
	*The mod that started it all. A simple food mod that inspired a nation, and more importantly a single modder with too much time on his hands.
	* Spaghetti Bolognese
		* A new meal type, made from meatballs and cooked pasta.
	* Pasta
		* Made from flour and milk, needs to be cooked to be eaten.
	* Cooked Pasta
		* Made by cooking pasta in a furnace, can be eaten for a small amount of hunger and saturation.
	* Meatball
		* Made from cooked beef, basically acts as a smaller steak and used in crafting spaghetti bolognese.
* Dog Food Mod
	* Another simple but classic mod from the legendary CR43Z33M0NK3Y, simply adds a dog food meant for feeding/healing dogs.
	* Dog Food
		* Made from rotten flesh and a piece of iron, it can be used as a strong healant for dogs. Poisonous to humans.
* Mossy Wooden Planks
	* A simple mod that inspired a much more in-depth addition. Originally simply a mossy oak plank, it has now spread to every wood block in the game (except it's not done yet so it hasn't yet shh).
	* Moss
		* A clump of moss that can be applied to blocks to add moss to them.
	* Mossy Planks
		* Available in each type of wood (except not yet), simply a moss covered plank. Truly beautiful in its simplicity.
